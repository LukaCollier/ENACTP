# About

This application replays ground traffic recorded at Paris-Charles-de-Gaulle airport, and displays it on a map, among other information.

It serves as the base of Python learning exercises, in which you will add new functionality and improve the code structure.

# Usage

## Running the application

In a terminal, move to the directory in which lies the code, then run the command `python app.py`. If you are using an IDE, such as VSCode, Pyzo, Spyder, etc., you should be able to run the app by pressing the "play" button.

You are greated by a window in which the airport map (runways and taxiways) are displayed (in gray), as well as the traffic (blue and magenta dots).

## Interactions

At the bottom of the window, a few buttons enable you to interact with the simulation (play/pause, forward or backward) or its display (zoom).

Mouse interactions
- mouse wheel to zoom in and out
- drag-and-drop to move the map
- hover on any point of interest to display tooltips with additional information

Keyboard shortcuts
- `+`/`-` to zoom in or out
- `space` to play/pause
- `Q` to quit
